The lifeCycle of a thread in Java consists of several states 
 which a thread can move through during its execution
 
 1) new: created but not started
 World t1 = new World();
 
 2) Runnable : after the start method is called , the thread becomes runnable.
  It's ready to run nd waiting forCPU time
  t1.start();
 
 3)Running : The thread is in the state when it is executing
 run();
 
 4)Blocked : when it is wair=ting for a resource or for the another thread to perform an action
 
 5)Terminated : A thread is in the state when it has finished executing
